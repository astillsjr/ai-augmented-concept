concept AINudgeEngine [User, Task, EmotionEntry]

purpose
    generate personalized, context-aware motivational nudges using AI, 
    leveraging user emotion history, task details, and behavior patterns

principle
    nudges are generated when a user schedules a task;
    when a nudge is prompted to be sent, the AI model analyzes the user’s 
    current mood trends, past task responses, and the nature of the task to 
    generate a motivational message

state
    a set of Nudges with
        a user String
        a task Task
        a deliveryTime Date
        a response (Accepted, Ignored, Snoozed, None)
        a message String (AI-generated)

actions    
    generate(user: User, task: Task, deliveryTime: Date): Nudge
        requires task exists and belongs to user; deliveryTime has not already passed
        effect creates a new nudge and returns it

    removeNudge(nudge: Nudge)
        requires nudge exists
        effect removes Nudge

    recordResponse(nudge: Nudge)
        requires nudge exists
        effect records the user's response to the nudge

    async nudgeUserAI(user: User, task: Task, emotions: [EmotionEntry]): String
        requires deliveryTime for some Nudge is in the past
        effect calls an LLM to generate a personalized motivational message that 
               references the user’s emotional pattern and task details
